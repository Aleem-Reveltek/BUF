# BUF


The Unified Business Framework (UBF) is a framework for understanding industries, businesses, and their connections from a relational and structural perspective. It aids organizations who consult in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) in planning large-scale project management. It helps in understanding, predicting, and directing decisions across entire industries and navigating multiple projects and organizations simultaneously. The UBF maps and observes S.T.A.R.s along their due course while aiding them in navigating obstacles in a defined manner. It also has a classification system based on SWARM Intelligence, Agile Methodology, and the DROID Ops (the latest DevOps and MLOps framework) which includes galaxies (businesses covering an entire industry defined by a NAICS code), black holes (largest companies inside the NAICS code), super novas (large events felt across an entire industry), solar systems (companies organized by their holding companies), suns (largest publicly visible company), super stars (flagship or role model company), stars (small company or project), moons (orbital, side project, etc.), comets (unstable projects), and asteroids (same as comets).

GALAXY: A business galaxy covers an entire industry, defined by a NAICS Code. A galaxy is a vast network of interconnected companies, organizations, and stakeholders that operate in the same industry, offering similar products or services, and competing for the same customers.

BLACK HOLE: Large Corporation at the center of a galaxy which slowly consumes all its competitors The black hole is identified by the largest companies inside the NAICS Code. At the center of every galaxy is a massive black hole that exerts a powerful gravitational force on everything around it.

SUPER NOVA: A Corporate Cosmic-Shifting event A large event that can be felt across the entire industry.

SOLAR SYSTEM: Companies in a business galaxy are organized by their holding companies, known as the Solar System. These solar systems are classified based on their size, market share, and SIC Codes. 

SUN: The largest publicly visible company inside a solar system or the headquarters of an organization.

SUPER STAR: A flagship or role model company that could one day become a sun. This could also be a fast growing project that is gaining momentum. Super Stars usually require a vast amount of resources and a large budget, yet they also achieve
